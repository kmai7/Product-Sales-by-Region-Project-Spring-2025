# Course Assingment: Managing with Data and Simulations (University of Maryland, College Park)
# Product-Sales-by-Region
For this assignment, I applied data modeling, simulation, and analysis techniques in Excel to support decision-making. I also worked with a large dataset on product sales across multiple regions, performing interpretation and visualization to identify key patterns and insights. Some of the techniques used included pivot tables, graphs, and descriptive statistics.
